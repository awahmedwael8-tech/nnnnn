## 2. Problem & Purpose

### Problem Statement
The instructor has courses ready to sell but no dedicated platform. Students have no single place to browse the courses, pay for them, watch the videos, and communicate with the instructor. Payment, content delivery, and support currently depend on scattered tools.

### Project Purpose
Build a self-owned Learning Management System (LMS), similar in learning experience to Udemy, for the instructor's own courses only. The platform is not a SaaS product and not a multi-instructor marketplace. It has two roles: Admin (the instructor) and Student.

### Business Value
- Full ownership of course content, pricing, branding, and student relationships.
- No marketplace fees or commissions.
- A manual InstaPay payment flow that matches how the target students already pay.
- Direct communication between the instructor and each student through in-platform chat and video comments.

### Opportunity
A single platform replaces fragmented tools for hosting, payment collection, and student support. This reduces the instructor's administrative overhead and creates one consistent learning experience for every student.

---

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goal
Launch a fully working LMS by 2026-12-21 where students can browse courses, pay manually via InstaPay, watch videos after payment approval, and chat with the admin.

### Objectives
1. Deliver role-based access with two dashboards (Admin and Student) by the end of Phase 1 (2026-11-08).
2. Enable the Admin to create courses and upload videos with descriptions and attachments by the end of Phase 1.
3. Enable manual InstaPay payment with screenshot upload and Admin accept/decline by the end of Phase 2 (2026-11-22).
4. Enable video comments and Admin–Student chat by the end of Phase 2.
5. Reach a median payment review time of 12 hours or less and an error rate below 0.1% within 30 days after launch.

### Success Definition
The project is successful when a new Student can register, submit an InstaPay payment proof, receive Admin approval, watch the course videos, comment on a video, and message the Admin, all without any manual intervention outside the platform (except the Admin's review action). All P0 acceptance criteria pass in QA, and the KPI targets in Section 12 are met within 30 days of public launch.

### Non-Goals
- Automated payment gateway integration.
- Multi-instructor or marketplace functionality.
- Native mobile application.
- Certificates, affiliate system, and live streaming.

---

## 4. Scope

### In Scope
- Two roles: Admin and Student, each with a dedicated dashboard.
- Course management: create, edit, publish, unpublish, delete courses and sections.
- Video upload with a description and downloadable attachments per video.
- Public course catalog and course detail pages.
- Manual payment via InstaPay: payment instructions, screenshot upload, Admin accept/decline with reason.
- Video playback restricted to students with an approved enrollment.
- Video comments with Admin replies.
- One-to-one chat between each Student and the Admin.

### Out of Scope
- Automatic payment gateway.
- Mobile application.
- Certificates.
- Affiliate system.
- Live streaming.
- Multi-instructor support, reviews and ratings, coupons, and subscriptions.

### Assumptions
- A single Admin account (the instructor) exists. It is created by a seed script at deployment, and no public Admin registration exists.
- All prices are set in EGP and displayed as a single fixed price per course.
- Payments are made by transfer to one InstaPay account configured by the Admin in settings.
- Students access the platform through a modern desktop or mobile browser.
- Transactional email (password reset, notifications) is sent through a third-party email provider [TBD].
- Video files are uploaded by the Admin in MP4 (H.264) format.

### Constraints
- Delivery deadline: 8 weeks from 2026-10-26 (launch on 2026-12-21).
- No payment gateway means every payment requires manual Admin review.
- Video storage and bandwidth costs are borne by the Owner.
- Maximum upload sizes: video 2 GB, attachment 50 MB, payment screenshot 5 MB.

### Dependencies
- Object storage provider (S3-compatible) for videos, attachments, and payment screenshots.
- Email delivery provider for password reset and notification emails.
- Design assets and UI design from the Designer, ready before Phase 1 ends.
- Admin availability to review payments and answer chat messages.
- Hosting accounts on Vercel and Railway.

#### P1-F004 — Profile Page

- **Description:** Users update their name, avatar, and password.
- **User Story:** As Omar (Student), I want to update my profile so that my information is correct.
- **Trigger:** The user opens "Profile".
- **Pre-conditions:** The user is authenticated.
- **Post-conditions:** The profile changes are saved.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. The user edits name or uploads an avatar (JPG, PNG, WebP, up to 2 MB).
  2. The client validates and calls PUT /api/v1/users/me.
  3. The server saves the changes and the client shows "Profile updated".
- **Alternate Flows:**
  - A1 — Password change: the user enters the current and new password; a wrong current password returns an inline error.
  - A2 — Invalid avatar file: the client rejects it with a message.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Name is required (2 to 80 characters).
  - [ ] Email is displayed and cannot be edited in v1.0.
  - [ ] Password change requires the correct current password and a new password of at least 8 characters.

#### P1-F005 — Admin Statistics Dashboard

- **Description:** The Admin dashboard shows key numbers about students, payments, and revenue.
- **User Story:** As Zizo (Admin), I want to see my platform numbers so that I can track business performance.
- **Trigger:** The Admin opens the dashboard home.
- **Pre-conditions:** The Admin is authenticated.
- **Post-conditions:** Statistics are displayed.
- **Main Flow:**
  1. The client calls GET /api/v1/admin/stats.
  2. The server returns total students, total enrollments, pending payments, approved payments, and total revenue (sum of approved payments).
  3. The client renders the values as cards and a per-course enrollment table.
- **Alternate Flows:**
  - A1 — No data: the cards display 0 and the table shows "No enrollments yet".
  - A2 — Request failure: the client shows an error with a Retry button.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] The dashboard shows total students, pending payments, approved payments, and total revenue.
  - [ ] Revenue includes only APPROVED payments and excludes revoked enrollments.
  - [ ] The stats endpoint returns in under 500 ms.
  - [ ] Only the Admin can call the stats endpoint.

### Authentication and Authorization Design
- JWT access token (15 minutes) and refresh token (7 days) with rotation on every refresh.
- Role-based middleware checks ADMIN or STUDENT on every protected route.
- Resource-level checks: enrollment check for videos, comments, and attachments; ownership check for payments and conversations.

### Infrastructure and Deployment
- Frontend on Vercel; backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis on Railway.
- Object storage bucket with private access and signed URLs.
- Environments: local, staging, production.
- CI/CD through GitHub Actions: lint, type-check, test, and deploy on merge to main.
- Prisma Migrate runs automatically on deploy to staging and manually approved on production.

### External Integrations
- Object storage provider (S3-compatible) [TBD].
- Email provider for password reset and notification emails [TBD].
- PostHog or Mixpanel for product analytics.
- InstaPay: no API integration; the account is displayed as text and payment is verified manually.

## 10. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation, Authentication, and Core Content (Sprint 1)
**Goal:** Working authentication and the core content feature: courses, sections, and videos managed by the Admin.
**Duration:** 2 weeks (2026-10-26 to 2026-11-08)

- [ ] Initialize repository, branch strategy, and CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up frontend, backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and object storage
- [ ] Implement Prisma schema for User, RefreshToken, Course, Section, Video, VideoAttachment, Setting
- [ ] Implement P0-F001 authentication, roles, and protected routes
- [ ] Seed the Admin account
- [ ] Build the Admin and Student dashboard shells
- [ ] Implement P0-F002 course and section management and the public catalog
- [ ] Implement P0-F003 video upload, description, and attachments
- [ ] Apply global UX rules (validation, loading, error, success components)

**Validation:** An Admin can log in, create a course with sections, upload a video with a description and an attachment, and publish the course. A visitor sees the course in the catalog. A Student is blocked from /admin. All P0-F001 to P0-F003 acceptance criteria pass.

### Phase 2 — Payments, Access, Comments, and Chat (Sprint 2)
**Goal:** Complete the money-to-learning loop and the communication features.
**Duration:** 2 weeks (2026-11-09 to 2026-11-22)

- [ ] Implement Payment, Enrollment, Comment, Conversation, and Message models
- [ ] Implement P0-F004 checkout page and screenshot submission
- [ ] Implement P0-F005 Admin payment review, approve, decline, and revoke
- [ ] Implement P0-F006 signed video streaming and enrollment-based access control
- [ ] Implement P0-F007 video comments and replies
- [ ] Implement P0-F008 real-time chat with Socket.IO in both dashboards
- [ ] Write integration tests for payment, access control, and chat permissions

**Validation:** A new Student completes the full journey: register, submit payment, Admin approves, Student watches a video, posts a comment, and exchanges a chat message with the Admin. All P0-F004 to P0-F008 acceptance criteria pass.

### Phase 3 — Polish and P1 Features (Sprint 3)
**Goal:** Improve the learning and administration experience.
**Duration:** 2 weeks (2026-11-23 to 2026-12-06)

- [ ] Implement P1-F001 course search
- [ ] Implement P1-F002 progress tracking and resume playback
- [ ] Implement P1-F003 in-app notifications and email notifications for payment decisions
- [ ] Implement P1-F004 profile page
- [ ] Implement P1-F005 Admin statistics dashboard
- [ ] Responsive and accessibility pass (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Begin beta onboarding materials for the first Students

**Validation:** All P1 acceptance criteria pass. Accessibility audit reports no critical issues. QA signs off on all P0 and P1 features on staging.

### Phase 4 — Launch Hardening (Sprint 4)
**Goal:** Make the platform secure, stable, and ready for public launch.
**Duration:** 2 weeks (2026-12-07 to 2026-12-20)

- [ ] Security review (authorization, file upload validation, rate limiting, signed URL expiry)
- [ ] Load test for 500 concurrent students
- [ ] Configure monitoring, alerts, and daily backups; test a restore
- [ ] Configure analytics events for the KPIs in Section 12
- [ ] Fix all open P0 and P1 defects
- [ ] Beta launch with a small group of Students (2026-12-13)
- [ ] Production deployment and smoke tests
- [ ] Implement P2 features only if capacity remains

**Validation:** Zero open P0 defects, load test passes, backup restore verified, beta feedback addressed, and the Owner approves the launch gate.
